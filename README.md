Run Jest tests by docBlock pragmas like those used in [jest-circus-allure-environment](https://github.com/ryparker/jest-circus-allure-environment)

**ðŸš§ This is currently under development. ðŸš§**

## âž• Jest patches

This project is contingent on [code changes to be approved and merged](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/10294) into the Jest project. For now I've implemented a workaround that applies [patches](./patches) to the Jest dependencies using [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package). This should happen automatically after installing the dependencies with `yarn install` /`npm install`.

If for some reason the patches were not applied automatically you can apply them by running:
```shell
yarn run postinstall
```

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. Add dependency to project

```shell
yarn add --dev jest-docblock-runner
```

2. Update Jest configuration:

__See Jest documentation for more information.__

```js
// Jest.config.js

{
  ...
  "runner": "jest-docblock-runner"
}
```

3. Add DocBlocks with pragmas to your tests

```js
// example.test.js
test('bank records update, when I withdraw $100 USD', () => {
  /**
   * @severity critical
   */

  ...
})
```

4. Run only the marked tests

```shell
yarn run jest --severity=critical
```

__Note: This will accept comma separated values and/or multiple flags.__
